Laravel Test 3
Once complete, a link to your submission along with any other resources

‚úÖ How will you be scored?
This test we feel allows you to express your resourcefulness with many
backend elements. It is for this reason we have left it pretty open.
Aspects to note:
A lot of emphasis will be on your familiarity with modern Laravel
development, tooling and techniques
Most best-practices and standards should be portrayed in your file
organisation, methods, naming conventions, validations, notifications etc.
The succinctness of your submission
Your ability to execute the required task
Since this is a relatively simple exercise, the quality of the submission
should be high
üíÖ Are there any other considerations?
Again, use this test as an opportunity to express yourself. Here are some of
the things we use and like - only to keep in mind, of course üòÑ
We like AWS and are a cloud-native company
We like Git
We always go above and beyond
We believe in quality code (think tests)
We like all the new GraphQL things (think Prisma, Hasura etc.)
We value security, strongly
üîí Closing
